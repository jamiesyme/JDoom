# JDoom

![Screenshot](/../screenshots/screenshot.png?raw=true "JDoom Screenshot")

JDoom is a demo of the ray casting rendering technique that was used in early FPS games, such as Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. It simulates a 3D environment despite the world and game logic being defined in 2D.

The original inspiration for this project came from Doom (hence "JDoom"), however the current state of the demo is much more similar to Wolfenstein 3D (no angled walls, single level, etc).

I also added reflection to some tiles (a common trait of ray tracers) just for fun.

## Usage

Using Firefox, open `index.html`.

I advise Firefox because I know Chrome prevents the local images from being used, which means all of the walls will be rendered black.

Use WASD to move around and use the arrow keys to rotate.
